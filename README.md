## Datasets

We will use multiple datasets for this project but the following is a preliminary dataset from IEEE used to create 
the IEEE 1584-2018 standard for arc flash prediction and calulation. Good starting point

Need to create an account (free) with IEEE to access data

```

```
Data is in excel files so needs to be processed before using





## TODOS:
1. Find more datasets
2. Find what factors are important in this data so we can integrate that into other models
3. Select ML model options
